# AppliedDataStructures
Practical and robust .NET-styled implementations of advanced data structures in C#, in which data structure classed are wrapped in .NET style and can easily get practical usage in .NET codes.

This repository is originally a playground for learning *Data Structure* class of Tsinghua Univerity, ([http://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~deng/ds/index.htm](Class Info Here)), and also for reading the book *Introduction to Algorithms*. So data structures implemented here are mainly from the class and the book, but also some from Wiki pages.
