# AppliedDataStructures
Practical and robust .NET-styled implementations of advanced data structures in C#, in which data structure classes are wrapped in .NET style and can get handy usage in .NET codes. Moreover, structures here are **extendable for maintaining extra information for algorithm problems** (e.g. assignments on Online Judges and ACM);

This repository is originally a playground for learning *Data Structure* class of Tsinghua Univerity, ([Class Info Here](http://dsa.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~deng/ds/index.htm)), and also for reading the book *Introduction to Algorithms*. So data structures implemented here are mainly from the class and the book, but also some from Wiki pages.

## Implemtation Roadmap

**The final goal of this project is to implement data structures listed in the [*List of Data Structures* in wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures).**

Basic dynamic data structures implemented by the .NET framework will not be considered.(like [*ArrayList*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/arraylist.cs), [*Vector/List*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/list.cs), [*Queue*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/compmod/system/collections/generic/queue.cs), [*Stack*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/compmod/system/collections/generic/stack.cs), [*Hash Table*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/hashtable.cs), [*Linked List*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System/compmod/system/collections/generic/linkedlist.cs), [*Bit Array*](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/bitarray.cs))

Simple data structure based on these structure will not be implemented here as well.(like [Two-way Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list), [Double-ended Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue), [Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Matrix_(computer_science)&redirect=no))

Algorithms implementations are not the goal of this project, but some of them will obviously be implemented when implementing data structures. And algorithm associated will implemented as much as possible.
